# Student Grades Prediction

This project uses historical temperature data to predict future temperatures using Linear Regression.

## Project Structure

- **student_performance_data.csv**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model. This is an open-data file from INAMHI of Ecuador.
- **E2_student_perf_lr_mult_vars.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- The remaining files' purposes are: plot formatting, and extra math functions.

## Versioning

- **Version 1**: Initial prediction model.
