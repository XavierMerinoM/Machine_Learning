# Temperature Prediction

This project leverages historical temperature data to predict future temperatures using Linear Regression. It aims to provide insights for climate analysis and decision-making in various sectors.

## Project Structure

- **inamhi-temperaturamedia-201912.csv**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model, representing temperatures recorded by the INAMHI of Ecuador.
- **E1_Temp_media_linear_regression.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- The remaining files' purposes are: plot formatting utilities to enhance visual data representation and additional mathematical functions for advanced data analysis.

## Versioning

- **Version 1**: Initial prediction model.
