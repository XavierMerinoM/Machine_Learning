# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains projects that implement traditional machine learning algorithms. Each project is organized into its directory with relevant code and documentation.

## Projects

1. **Temperature Prediction**
   - This project uses historical temperature data to predict future temperatures using raw functions.
   - [Temperature Prediction Project](https://github.com/XavierMerinoM/Machine_Learning/tree/main/1-Temperature_Prediction)

2. **Student Grades Prediction V1**
   - This project aims to predict student grades based on various features using raw functions.
   - [Student Grades Prediction V1 Project](https://github.com/XavierMerinoM/Machine_Learning/tree/main/2-Student_Grades_Prediction_V1)

3. **Student Grades Prediction V2**
   - An improved version of the Student Grades Prediction project with additional features and refined models using scikit-learn.
   - [Student Grades Prediction V2 Project](https://github.com/XavierMerinoM/Machine_Learning/tree/main/3-Student_Grades_Prediction_V2)

4. **Student_Pass_Clasification**
   - This project uses the same database of Student Grades Prediction V1 and V2 to classify whether a student passes a subject.
   - [Student_Pass_Clasification](https://github.com/XavierMerinoM/Machine_Learning/tree/main/4-Student_Pass_Clasification)

## Repository Structure

- Each project directory contains its own README.md file with more detailed information about the project.
- The code is primarily written in Jupyter Notebooks and Python.

## Getting Started
